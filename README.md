Numerical Simulation of teh Heat Flow in a Rod and Heat Sensitive Bath

Matlab/Octave files modeling the temperature distribution and temporal evolution in a rod and heat-sensitive bath. A variety of numerical and sampling methods are compared to demonstrate their individual characteristics.

A summary is presented in the Write Up.pdf file.
